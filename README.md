# Build a Wall

Most of us were playing with Lego (or even better, [Tente](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/TENTE)) when we were children,
and we know how complex is to build something strong that doesn't fall down when you have to add something heavy above,
right?

We had discovered, after many times and frustration, that the bricks for any wall have to be well-placed among each
others to achieve a really strong wall.

So, the aim of this Challenge is to create the strongest wall of all time! You will have to combine bricks, in a proper
way, to avoid instability.

## How it works?

This is a CLI application that receives 2 arguments and represent the created wall in ASCII, easy-peasy,
isn't it? Well, let's see... 

To do so, your CLI command have to receive the following parameters:
* `Number of rows`: The number of rows of bricks the wall has to have
* `Number of bricks`: The number of bricks you have to use on each row to represent the wall.

### Constraints

### How to represent your wall

To represent your one-and-only creation you have to use the following elements:
* `■■`: A full brick (2 of `■`). The bigger brick for the wall
* `■`: Half a brick. The smallest unit
* `|`: Mortar. The cement between each brick on the same row

#### How to build a strong wall

Any builder knows that, if you just put a brick over another, your wall is going to fall down as you turn your back! 

To build a strong wall you have to follow these considerations:
* There has to be a mortar (`|`) every brick (half or full) on the same row
* Bricks cannot be aligned vertically with the bricks of the row above or below it, to provide more stability

### Constraints

* If one or both of the arguments aren't valid (less than 1 brick, isn't integer, not present, ...etc) return `null`.
* If the number of bricks required to build the wall is greater than 10.000 return `Naah, too much...here's my resignation.`

### Examples,

Here you could see some examples of the expected output:

```bash
$> build 5 5
     ■■|■■|■■|■■|■■
     ■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■
     ■■|■■|■■|■■|■■
     ■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■
     ■■|■■|■■|■■|■■

$> build 10 7
     ■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■
     ■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■
     ■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■
     ■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■
     ■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■
     ■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■
     ■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■
     ■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■
     ■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■
     ■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■|■■

$> build "eight" [3]
    null
    
$> build 12 -4
    null
    
$> build 123 1024
    Naah, too much...here's my resignation.
```

## Technical requirements

* We expect you to solve this Challenge by following an Object-Oriented and SOLID principles
* Create a **clean**, **maintainable** and **well-designed** code. We expect to see a good and clear architecture that
  allows to add or modify the solution without so much troubles.
* **Test** your code until you are comfortable with it. We don't expect a 100% of Code Coverage but some tests that
  helps to have a more stable and confident base code.

To understand how you take decisions during the implementation, **please write a COMMENTS.md** file explaining some of
the most important parts of the application. You would also be able to defend your code through
[Rviewer](https://rviewer.io), once you submit your solution.

## How to submit your solution

* Push your code to the `devel` branch - we encourage you to commit regularly to show your thinking process was.
* **Create a new Pull Request** to `main` branch & **merge it**.

Once merged you **won't be able to change or add** anything to your solution, so double-check that everything is as
you expected!

Remember that **there is no countdown**, so take your time and implement a solution that you are proud!
